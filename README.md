Hello From the Linux Community!!

My name is Nate T. I just came across your initiative, and I am already a big fan! 

_INTRODUCTION_

    *
    *

_ABOUT_ _MYSELF_

    *Recently converted a decent-specd., 2005-2010, HP laptop to a dual OS machine, with the help of an external hard drive, which acts as the master partition.
    *All is good except the input driver for the synaptics touchpad. The lack of dual touch seriously drove me back to windows.
    *The point is that I didnt realize how interesting and enjoyable the systems side of programming could be
    *My main reason for dev is to LEARN! It is serioualy a borderline addiction. Once I get overly fluent in any aspect, it is time to move on...   XD
    *My main drive in life is now officially this new obsession with the Synaptics "mystery protocol" and their various bugs that break 2-finger-tech on certain devices, even though the same device's windows (7 & 10!!) drivers still work flawlessy??????
    *used to be an open source fan boy
        *PARA
    *Now, I am so so. Depends on whether the project is worth it...
    *Last night, I was seriously considering getting involved, but finding worthy projects is a task
    *Ended up hereout of neccessity~(SEE ABOVE)
    
###CALL TO ACTION
    
    *What I want to achieve
        *Learn (INSIDE & OUT!!) all of the various driver
        *Learn about your project:
            *Solo or Team?
            *methodology (if team) -- Scrum, Kanban, other agile, waterfall?
            *history with project; Why this? What has the process been like so far?
            *Any significant hurdles up to now?
            *Future: Do you plan to add/ upgrade anything,;if so, what? 
        *Learn EVERYTHING about Synaptics Company, Hardware, & Software
        *Demystify Synaptics protocol
        *Determine exactly how your software fits in with the product I have in mind
        * If needed, Revise my product vision based on what I learn from your experiences.
        *Sketch out a rough-Idea themed work order/ Project Spec Sheet draft.
        From This, start brainstorming features/ user stories; Start shaping the Project backlog.
        *Set up a small but fairly talented (possibly just a couple close friends) Scrum team to work on the project.
        * Shape Proj Backlog into a draft worthy of an initial sprint cycle...
        
 ###WHERE YOU COME IN!
     
     For now, a TL;DR for this section.
     
     I want to do something very similar to what you are doing, but for linux (at least all Debian derived distros, and maybe more.) It is _desperately_ needed
     because synaptic drivers barely work on linux, especially for 2-finger capability. There are a couple questions that I want to ask you regarding this.
     
     Are there other developers involved. Did you build the windows app yourself or as part of a team?
     
     Have you considered taking on Linux capability?
     
     If so, what held you back?
     
     (I have a lot more small ?s, but the TL;DR is getting TL.  XD )
     
     And finally, I wanted to discuss our options regarding working together in some capacity going forward. I believe that strong coordination and communication will benefit us both greatly! After all, we are sort of "digging the same tunnel" now, albeit side-by-side. Either we can put both our efforts into a luxurious two-wide tunnel or we can dig two randomly parallel tunnels 6 feet apart, neither one of which does the other any good. anyway, get back to me either way, if you do not mind. I will put my contact details at the top. Thanks, and sorry about length. I definately didn't plan it out that way. And I technically didn't finish! I get extremely passionate about new projects.
     
Sincerely,

Nathan T.

--------

[TwoFingerScroll_1_0_6.zip][1]

What is it?
-----------

This project aims at providing a tool for Windows platform adding some useful
two finger gestures to Synaptics TouchPads. These TouchPads can be found in many
today's laptops and many of them support multiple finger gestures.

Supported gestures:
 * Two finger scrolling - scroll vertically by sliding two fingers anywhere on the TouchPad,
 * Two finger tapping - tap with two fingers to simulate a selected mouse button.
